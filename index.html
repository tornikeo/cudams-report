        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            In this report, we describe how we developed a CUDA-accelerated version of <a href="https://matchms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/matchms/similarity/CosineGreedy.html#CosineGreedy">CosineGreedy</a>.
            This is a short report that will focus on existing and prior practical problems during development, as well as a brief note on performance of the module.

        <h3>Background</h3>
        
        <p>This work is in the field of metabolomics.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>Metabolomics</strong> is the scientific study of chemical processes involving metabolites, the small molecule substrates, intermediates, and products of cell metabolism. Specifically, metabolomics is the "systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints that specific cellular processes leave behind", the study of their small-molecule metabolite profiles.

        <blockquote>
          In biochemistry, a <strong>metabolite</strong> is an intermediate or end product of metabolism ...  Understanding how pharmaceutical compounds are metabolized and the potential side effects of their metabolites is an important part of drug discovery.

        <p>In particular, the main task of which CudaSSM is but a single step, is scanning bio-material (i.e. plant matter) by mass spectrometry and finding <em>similarities</em> between the scanning results and results of already-known chemicals from a large database, say, the <a href="https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash.jsp">GNPS dataset</a></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Mass spectrometry (MS), also called mass spec, is an analytical technique that is used to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. The results are presented as a mass spectrum, a plot of intensity as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. Mass spectrometry is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as complex mixtures. 
          </p>
          <p>Mass spectrometry has both qualitative and quantitative uses. These include <strong>identifying unknown compounds</strong>, determining the isotopic composition of elements in a molecule, and <strong>determining the structure of a compound</strong> by observing its fragmentation.</p>

        <p>The assumption is that if some scanning results consistently have high similarity with already-known compounds, then the scanned matter likely contains those compounds. In lay-terms this could mean detecting an aspirin-like chemical in a common houseplant.</p>
        
        <h4>MatchMS and CudaSSM</h4>
        <p>Analysis of large volume of mass spectrometry data requires computation. The "gold standard" in open-source mass-spectrometry data analysis is a python package called <a href="https://github.com/matchms/matchms">MatchMS</a>. </p>

        <blockquote>
          MatchMS is a versatile open-source Python package developed for importing, processing, cleaning, and comparing mass spectrometry data (MS/MS). It facilitates the implementation of straightforward, reproducible workflows, transforming raw data from common mass spectra file formats into pre- and post-processed spectral data, and <strong>enabling large-scale spectral similarity comparisons</strong>.

        <p>Unfortunately, MatchMS isn't designed for handling extremely large spectra. </p>
